This week in Computer Science, we learned some pretty big things. In the beginning of the week, we worked with test cases vs. contracts or images versus values then worked with tables. The next day, we worked with what exactly a contracts are and how they are definitions. Contracts, being generally what the code should do, and definitions, being how specifically the code does this action. Example of a contract is ```double :: ( y :: Number ) ->``` and oone of a definition is ```fun double (y): ( 2 * y ) end```. 

I feel like discerning the difference between th e meaning of a contracvt and definitions was definetly the biggest thing I learned this week. I was pretty confused with both concepts and couldnt really define either. But after the class I felt I had a fairly good understanding of what both meant. Also learning what a test case was, was pretty important too. In all, i feel like this week has been pretty crucial even with the weirdness of how class was this week. But hopefully its better next week.
