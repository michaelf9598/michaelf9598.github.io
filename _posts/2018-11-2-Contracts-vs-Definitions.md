This week in Computer Science, we learned some pretty big things. In the beginning of the week, we worked with test cases vs. contracts or images versus values then worked with tables. The next day, we worked with what exactly a contracts are and how they are definitions. Contracts, being generally what the code should do, and definitions, being how specifically the code does this action. Example of a contract is ```double :: ( y :: Number ) ->``` and oone of a definition is ```fun double (y): ( 2 * y ) end```.
