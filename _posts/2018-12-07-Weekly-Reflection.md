This was a pretty important week for our progression as students in a few ways. Firstly, we started on our advanced flag project that week which we've been talking about for the past few months. We also talked a lot about our development as a class and what our next steps should be. Honestly, as a clas i feel like at some point we needed that discussion because it brought a lot of our worries and problems into the light for the teacher and to each other.
