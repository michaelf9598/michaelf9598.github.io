This was a pretty important week for our progression as students in a few ways. Firstly, we started on our advanced flag project that week which we've been talking about for the past few months. We also talked a lot about our development as a class and what our next steps should be. Honestly, as a class i feel like at some point we needed that discussion because it brought a lot of our worries and problems into the light and helped us a lot in the class. This being an AP class, its going to get difficult and knowing where our faults are and how to just improve on a personal level with this subject was important.

As a class, this class needs to achieve a few things before we take this regents and i think we may be able to with some work. To move on we really need to focus on making our own sets of code prom scratch. Getting used to using the ```include image``` command or even just making tables or definitionas by ourselves are really important. I know
