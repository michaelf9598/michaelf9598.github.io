This was a pretty important week for our progression as students in a few ways. Firstly, we started on our advanced flag project that week which we've been talking about for the past few months. We also talked a lot about our development as a class and what our next steps should be. Honestly, as a class i feel like at some point we needed that discussion because it brought a lot of our worries and problems into the light and helped us a lot in the class. This being an AP class, its going to get difficult and knowing where our faults are and how to just improve on a personal level with this subject was important.

As a class, this class needs to achieve a few things before we take this regents and i think we may be able to with some work. To move on we really need to focus on making our own sets of code prom scratch. Getting used to using the ```include image``` command or even just making tables or definitionas by ourselves are really important. I know that at this moment, i wopuld really strugglke with making my own code and I think being repatative with making our own is something taht will help us. We also as a class need to be more motivated with our work. Maybe this means going to after school or putting extra work outside of class or even having homework would force us to do better. Finally, knowing exactly whats top be expected and what we have to know before taking the test would be important because i was blindsided by the benchmark test because i never knew any of that stuff was required or even a part of this test. I dont know if itll be exactly like that but us not evenm mentioning it yet concerned me and even though i didnt do terrible id like to be more informed about what exactly will be on it will help the class. I think these three things could just improve the classes understanding of the subject and i dont know how easy some of these are to just do but i hope its something we can work on as a class.
