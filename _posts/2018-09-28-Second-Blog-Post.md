  Welcome back. In APCS class this week, we've been working on a lot of different concepts and programs to help us understand Programming languages. Weve also learned about animation, coordinates and how to create different effects in the Pyret program.Working with the Pyret program allows us to ultilize unique code to complete specific tasks.
  
  I feek like im in a good place in that class. I understand the material and so far I understand how to use the Pyret program. I feel like I may struggle with the animation aspect since last year I had similar troubles in my introduction to CS class. I also may struggle with remembering what everyone does but I feel like in due time I can understand the language. In All, I feel like im doing well in the class and cant wait to learn more.
