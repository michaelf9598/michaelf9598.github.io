Hey! I worked with some new concepts in this week's AP Computer science class. We worked with a variety of ideas such as the meaning of certain tags, layering of images and image information.

I feel this week went well. It wasnt entirely challenging but it got me to think of new elements in animations. These include layering and understanding images in code.
In the future this could be used in a variety of ways in animation and was ultimately useful to know in the long run.
