Greetings, In AP Computer Science. This week in computer science, we finalized the creation of our Blogs. One of my greatest challenges in the process was learning about the purposes of certain directories and pieces of code. I also had trouble trouble shooting lines of code. Being new to this coding language I felt alienated and unsure of everything but now I have a better grasp of this topic. 

I feel like throughout this class, Ill learn more about coding languages I can utilize i the future and get something useful out of the class. A goal for my year is to not to only pass, but to be able to be able to do something new and actually show proof. If i dont achieve that goal, im ok with just learnning anything new at all.
 
This class will ultimatley be beneficial for my future since im trying to take up beingt a sofware enginneer. I hope to succeed and grow as a computer science student.
