For the past 1/3 of the semester we covered a lot of ground. We worked with basic concepts such as the function to create images to ideas such as the differences between the definitions of different coding languages and their purposes. Making connections have been a major part of our goal and is what we strived for as a class. 

Some personal connections i've seen in this class, is that we conduct similarly to college students
