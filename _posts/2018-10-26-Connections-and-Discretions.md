For the past 1/3 of the semester we covered a lot of ground. We worked with basic concepts such as the function to create images to ideas such as the differences between the definitions of different coding languages and their purposes. Making connections have been a major part of our goal and is what we strived for as a class. I can connect certain types of code that are integral to both assignments.

Some personal connections i've seen in this class are the ways we use code. In the past week or two, we've been working on tables, using data from various different examples. Ive noticed that similar code has been used in both the table assignment and the flag project. Using code to equal other code such as ```shapes = table: name, corners``` in the table assignmenty and the place image code ```RBRW = place-image(RW,100,100,RB)``` in the flag project. Noticing this, I can connect that using equal signs are important base blocks in code that are commonly used and are needed for basic functions. Proving this, in the flag project, I used them to to create basic images with more than two shapes. Withought this sign I couldnt have created the flag, showing its necessity. Another connection I made is the use of ```include``` functions in both code sets. Both are used as basic functions that allow the entire set of code to work. In all, both pieces of code allow to make even the most basic of code function and are a necessary part for most actions, be it intermediate to experienced.
