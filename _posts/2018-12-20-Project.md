## Flag of Malaysia by Michael Figueroa

## Describe your program

-  I designed the Malaysian Flag 
-  I expect a professional, grade 4.


## Current output

## Describe your process.

-   What questions, strategies, help from peers or teacher, or thinking got you to this point? _then delete this instruction_

What initially helped me when starting this project is incorporating the use of fractions and definitions for certain measurements. This kind of confused me about why but it ended up making my code much easier to understand and proportions. It ultimately helped my finalize and make a fucntioning set of code that is practical and makes sense.


## Explain your code.


```
RS = radial-star(14,20,55,"solid","gold")

RR = rectangle(wsize,lsize,"solid","red")

WS = rectangle(wsize,lsize / 14,"solid","white")

BR = rectangle(wsize / 2, 250,"solid","dark-blue")

YC = circle(300 / 5, "solid","gold")

BC = circle(300 / 5.7, "solid","dark-blue")

RRWS7 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 252 ,RRWS6)

RRWS8 = place-image(BR,150,50,RRWS7)

Circ = place-image(YC,120,85,RRWS8)

Cece = place-image(BC,135,85,Circ)

Flag = place-image(RS,180,85,Cece)


```

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.
 -   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_


In my code, RS is the definition of a golden 14 sided radial star that i used in my flag. Indepemdemtly its just a normal radial star but in the program its used in place-image functions and is a part of a whole image. Line RR is a red rectangle and independently, its only a rectangle but in the whole program it both serves as the base image everything is put on and several stripes on the flag. Line WS is a rectangle that is fourteenths the size of the value of wsize. Independently, it is merely a thin white rectangle but in the function it is an accurately proportioned stripe that was positioned multiple times to form the required stripes. BR is a dark blue rectangle and independently it is only a shape but in the function it is the base for the radial star and the creasant that is crutial to identifying the flag. Then next line of code is YC which is a golden circle. Independently it is just an image but in the function it is used to form the colored part of the creasant which was one of the more important and slightly complicated part of the whole image. the next line is BC, a dark blue and slightly small verision of shape YC. Independently it does nothing but in the function it helps to form the much required creasant by blocking a portion of the other shape. The next line is a place-image definition called RRWS7 which shows the white stripes that are correctly proportioned and seperated. In the function is provides another layer to place other images on. Line RRWS8 is the place-image where the blue rectangle is placed onto the flag. Line Cece adds a second layer to the flag making it more complex. Line Flag finalizes the code and displays the whole flag in completion

## Program code

```
include image

wsize = 600 
lsize = 300 
#BASE
RS = radial-star(14,20,55,"solid","gold")

RR = rectangle(wsize,lsize,"solid","red")

WS = rectangle(wsize,lsize / 14,"solid","white")

BR = rectangle(wsize / 2, 250,"solid","dark-blue")

YC = circle(300 / 5, "solid","gold")

BC = circle(300 / 5.7, "solid","dark-blue")

#COMP

RRWS = place-image(WS,300,290,RR)

RRWS2 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 42 ,RRWS)

RRWS3 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 84 ,RRWS2)

RRWS4 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 126 ,RRWS3)

RRWS5 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 168 ,RRWS4)

RRWS6 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 210 ,RRWS5)

RRWS7 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 252 ,RRWS6)

RRWS8 = place-image(BR,150,50,RRWS7)

Circ = place-image(YC,120,85,RRWS8)

Cece = place-image(BC,135,85,Circ)

Flag = place-image(RS,180,85,Cece)```
