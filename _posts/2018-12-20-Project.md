## Flag of Malaysia by Michael Figueroa

## Describe your program

-  I designed the Malaysian Flag 
-  I expect a professional, grade 4.


## Current output

## Describe your process.

-   What questions, strategies, help from peers or teacher, or thinking got you to this point? _then delete this instruction_

What initially helped me when starting this project is incorporating the use of fractions and definitions for certain measurements. This kind of confused me about why but it ended up making my code much easier to understand and proportions. It ultimately helped my finalize and make a fucntioning set of code that is practical and makes sense.


## Explain your code.
```
RS = radial-star(14,20,55,"solid","gold")

RR = rectangle(wsize,lsize,"solid","red")

WS = rectangle(wsize,lsize / 14,"solid","white")

BR = rectangle(wsize / 2, 250,"solid","dark-blue")

YC = circle(300 / 5, "solid","gold")

BC = circle(300 / 5.7, "solid","dark-blue")
```
-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
In my code, RS is the definition of a golden 14 sided radial star that i used in my flag. Indepemdemtly its just a normal radial star but in the program its used in place-image functions and is a part of a whole image. Line RR is a red rectangle and independently, its only a rectangle but in the whole program it both serves as the base image everything is put on and several stripes on the flag. Line WS is a rectangle that is fourteenths the size of the value of wsize. Independently, it is merely a thin white rectangle but in the function it is an accurately proportioned stripe that was positioned multiple times to form the required stripes. BR is a dark blue rectangle and independently it is only a shape but in the function it is the base for the radial star and the creasant that is crutial to identifying the flag.



-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.

## Program code

```
include image

wsize = 600 
lsize = 300 
#BASE
RS = radial-star(14,20,55,"solid","gold")

RR = rectangle(wsize,lsize,"solid","red")

WS = rectangle(wsize,lsize / 14,"solid","white")

BR = rectangle(wsize / 2, 250,"solid","dark-blue")

YC = circle(300 / 5, "solid","gold")

BC = circle(300 / 5.7, "solid","dark-blue")

#COMP

RRWS = place-image(WS,300,290,RR)

RRWS2 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 42 ,RRWS)

RRWS3 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 84 ,RRWS2)

RRWS4 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 126 ,RRWS3)

RRWS5 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 168 ,RRWS4)

RRWS6 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 210 ,RRWS5)

RRWS7 = place-image(WS,300,290 - 252 ,RRWS6)

RRWS8 = place-image(BR,150,50,RRWS7)

Circ = place-image(YC,120,85,RRWS8)

Cece = place-image(BC,135,85,Circ)

Flag = place-image(RS,180,85,Cece)```
