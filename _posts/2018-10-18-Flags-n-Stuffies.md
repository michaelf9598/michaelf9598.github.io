This week in AP Computer science, we finally completed our two week long flag project. In this project, we worked with several new concepts and pieces of code. In this project, I've used code I have never used before such as ```Northkorea = place-image(RS,100,100,CF) ```. This function allowed me to include a third image to the place-image function, meanning I can create an image with more than 2 images. By defining this fuinction an imputting it, it allowed me to solve a problem I struggled with in the beginning. In all, I used many different pieces of code and learned more about how to create new functions and functional code. The flags I created are present below.

In all last week, I struggled for a good amount of time. I previously was unaware that you could define functions and use them in the ```place-image```
