This week we learned a lot about what is required of us as students and a lot about functions, contracts, test cases
, and definitions. AS students, we're need to know how to make unique functions that do a specific tast to succeed in class as well as make a final project involving it later down the line. We're learning how to, by using pre made functions to see how they work and how to use contracts, definitions, and test cases to create them. In the bigging of the week we used cakes as examples to make functions such as the ```taller-than(cake-1,cake-2)``` function. Then we worked on creating the function ```perimeter-to-meter``` which tested us on our ability to solve problems.


In all, this week was pretty important, though i feel I may start saying that about every week from now on.
But in the beginnig of the week we started out with a pretty important word, beiong abstractions. I feel like abstractuions are a pretty important thing to do in computer science, making what ever youre creating do its main purpose with the least amount of actions or pieces and making your work or ideas efficient.  Tables are an example of this showing on the essential information provided and hiding all the other pieces of code to present the information. Another important thing this week was learning how to create functions. Learning how to properly make them is really important and involves a lot of thinking and problem solving which will make them challenging but hopefully I get the hang of them. My biggest problem is bopoleans I feel becaus eof the extra pieces of code it requires compared to other data. In all, im a long ways away from making my own project and passing the course but I feel with enough work I can start making my own code soon.
