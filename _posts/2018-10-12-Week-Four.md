  This week in AP computer science we worked with a lot of different pieces of code and concepts involving computer science. To begin the week, we worked with different functions. These include the function of circles and the meaning of API which is " application programming interface". We also learned that images are first class pieces of code. Thhe next day, we learned about college problem solving which means two coders on one computer. This method covers both low and high levels of thinking and is the preferable method of problem solving. After tha day, we learned to create beter reflections.
  
  In all, I feel we had a productive week. I previously was unaware of the uses of and the functions themselves. I also think learning how to better reflect was beneficial in the long run of this class. Now, I want to learn how to create other pieces of code and unique code itself. Learning these could be helpful in my future as a software engineer. In all I feel like the classes are useful and are work well.
